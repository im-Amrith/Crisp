Agriculture, which sustains nearly 50% of the workforce, remains largely dependent on traditional practices, plagued by fragmented landholdings, low productivity, and delayed access to data. With rising pollution, unpredictable weather patterns, and an increasing number of mouths to feed, there is an urgent need to transform agriculture into a data-driven, sustainable, and intelligent system.\n\n---\n\n## ❓ Problem\n\nDespite advances in AI and IoT, most farmers still lack access to integrated digital platforms that bring together insights for crop management, livestock care, market forecasting, and government schemes. The absence of such a unified, intelligent system forces farmers to rely on reactive decisions, resulting in crop losses, misinformed harvesting, and reduced profitability. Without smart technology, India's ability to ensure food security and climate-resilient agriculture is at risk.\n\n---\n\n## 👥 Customer\n\nCrispRoot is designed for Indian farmers and agricultural stakeholders (e.g., cooperatives, agri-extension workers). The main users are digitally underserved farmers needing decision support.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Value Proposition\n\nSolves real challenges of low yield, disease outbreaks, and market unpredictability through AI-powered, multilingual, mobile-first tools. It improves productivity, reduces resource waste, and empowers informed decision-making.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Product\n\nA unified, mobile/web-based platform offering crop growth modeling, disease detection (crop/livestock), market forecasts, scheme access, and community support—accessible offline and with voice input.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Objectives\n\n- Increase crop yields by 25–30% using PCSE simulation  \n- Detect diseases with ≥90% F1-score  \n- Predict market trends with ≥85% accuracy  \n- Improve water and pesticide efficiency by 35–40%\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks and Challenges\n\n- Low digital literacy → mitigated with icon-based UI and voice features  \n- Internet issues → offline mode enabled  \n- Model accuracy → retraining and MLOps pipelines  \n- Funding scale-up → multi-stream revenue model\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Task\n\nCrispRoot handles a diverse set of AI/ML tasks:\n- **Image Classification**: Plant disease detection using CNNs (e.g., MobileNetV2)\n- **Ensemble Learning**: Livestock disease prediction using Random Forest based on symptoms\n- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Market price prediction using feedforward neural networks\n- **Crop Simulation**: Growth modeling using PCSE/WOFOST with BBCH scale inputs\n **Conversational AI Agent**: Chatbot interface on the website that assists users in local language, answers queries, suggests services, and guides farmers through crop, livestock, and scheme modules.\n-**Biosphere / Integrated Farming Modeling**  \n  Supports simulation and recommendation for multi-layer farming systems, such as **fish-rice co-cultivation**, promoting sustainability, biodiversity, and optimized resource use.\n- **CRISP Gene Compatibility Scoring**  \n  Predicts the hybridization potential between two plant varieties using genomic and phenotypic data.  \n  Provides a compatibility score to guide breeders in selecting optimal gene pairings for improved yield, resistance, and climate adaptability.\n\n---\n\n## 📏 Metrics\n\n**ML:** Accuracy, F1-score, MAE, RMSE  \n**Business:** Yield gain %, income improvement, user satisfaction (≥4.2/5), adoption rate\n\n---\n\n\n## 🧬 Data\n\n- External APIs: OpenWeatherMap, SoilGrids, Agmarknet(OGD) \n- User-generated: crop data, images, livestock symptoms  \n- Storage: Firebase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Continuous Improvement\n\nModel retraining using real-time user data and feedback, MLOps pipeline with automated testing, community flagging, and seasonal pattern tracking.\n\n---\n\n## 👥 Resources - Human\n\n- 2 AI/ML engineers  \n- 2 Backend developers  \n- 1 UI/UX designer  \n\n---\n\n## 🖥️ Resources - Compute\n\n- Cloud-based scalable infrastructure (16–64GB RAM per instance)  \n- GPU  instances for ML training  \n- Firebase hosting + containerized services (Docker, K8s)\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
